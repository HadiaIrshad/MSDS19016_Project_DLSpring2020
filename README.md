# Dataset
For this research project we have used two different datasets.
-We have used Village Finder dataset compiled by this paper.Which can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1REaNUpaD6Dm64v1FEDop20LgJtXvorXz?usp=sharing)

-To train our multi task learning model we had compiled a separate data set containing satellite images of different cities of pakistan.We than manually labeled them for differnet features.Dataset along with its labels can be find [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1krdvIv_RydPIDkCCNyJoFycnCDAidp-K?usp=sharing)

# Models
All the Trained models for each tasks can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1--uh8mXfwMKAH2pL24_yw6RMAC8h-fmu/view?usp=sharing)

# Phase 1
For first phase we use Unet Architecture to find buildings in the images
The Result of the model is as follows

Some of the predictions by the model are.
